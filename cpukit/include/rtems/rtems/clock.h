 * @parblock
 * The date, time, and ticks specified by ``time_of_day`` are all
 * range-checked, and an error is returned if any one is out of its valid
 * range.
 *
 * RTEMS can represent time points of this clock in nanoseconds ranging from
 * 1988-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z to 2514-05-31T01:53:03.999999999Z.  The
 * future uptime of the system shall be in this range, otherwise the system
 * behaviour is undefined.
 *
 * The specified time is based on the configured clock tick rate, see the
 * #CONFIGURE_MICROSECONDS_PER_TICK application configuration option.
 *
 * Setting the time forward will fire all CLOCK_REALTIME timers which are
 * scheduled at a time point before or at the time set by the directive.  This
 * may unblock tasks, which may preempt the calling task. User-provided timer
 * routines will execute in the context of the caller.
 *
 * It is allowed to call this directive from within interrupt context, however,
 * this is not recommended since an arbitrary number of timers may fire.
 *
 * The directive shall be called at least once to enable the service of
 * CLOCK_REALTIME related directives.  If the clock is not set at least once,
 * they may return an error status.
