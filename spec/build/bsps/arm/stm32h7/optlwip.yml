name: STM32H7_ADD_LWIP
description: |
  This changes the code to allow lwIP to work properly, based on the
  STM32 lwIP example. The lwIP DMA descriptors will be placed inside
  SRAM3, similarly to the linker script provided by STM. The user
  still needs to set the lwIP heap memory location, configure the MPU
  properly and do the configuration of the hardware and other peripherals.
